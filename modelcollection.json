Furthermore, direct single-channel determinations of channel open probability (P(o)) and kinetic simulations demonstrate that CDF represents a genuine enhancement of open probability, without appreciable change of activation kinetics.

The model reproduces a range of experimentally observed phenomena including afterdepolarizing potentials, spike widening at the end of the burst, and rebound.

The spatial distribution of synaptic weights throughout the dendrites will markedly differ under the local versus global HSP mechanisms. We suggest an experimental paradigm to unravel which type of HSP mechanism operates in the dendritic tree. The answer to this question will have important implications to our understanding of the functional organization of the neuron.\"",

Structurally varying dendritic topology and length in a simplified model allows us to separate out the physical parameters derived from morphology underlying burst firing. To perform the parameter scans we created a new NEURON tool the MultipleRunControl which can be used to easily set up a parameter scan and write the simulation results to file. Using this code we found that not input conductance but the arrival time of the return current, as measured provisionally by the average electrotonic path length, determines whether the pyramidal cell (with ping-pong model dynamics) will burst or fire single spikes.",

There is increasing anatomical evidence that these cells are organized in columns,  and that the columns processing a given odor are arranged in widely distributed arrays.  Experimental evidence is lacking on the underlying learning mechanisms for how these  columns and arrays are formed.  We have used a simplified realistic circuit model to test the hypothesis that  distributed connectivity can self-organize through an activity-dependent dendrodendritic  synaptic mechanism.  The results point to action potentials propagating in the mitral cell lateral dendrites  as playing a critical role in this mechanism, and suggest a novel and robust learning  mechanism for the development of distributed processing units in a cortical structure.",

Hodgkin identified three classes of neurons with qualitatively different analog-to-digital transduction properties.   Despite widespread use of this classification scheme, a generalizable explanation of its biophysical basis has not been described.   We recorded from spinal sensory neurons representing each class and reproduced their transduction properties in a minimal model. With phase plane and bifurcation analysis, each class of excitability was shown to derive from distinct spike initiating dynamics.   Excitability could be converted between all three classes by varying single parameters; moreover, several parameters, when varied one at a time, had functionally equivalent effects on excitability. From this, we conclude that the spike-initiating dynamics associated with each of Hodgkin\u2019s classes represent different outcomes in a nonlinear competition between oppositely directed, kinetically mismatched currents. ...\"",

        "text": "\"... This article provides tools for an analytic treatment of reward-modulated STDP, which allows us to predict under which conditions reward-modulated STDP will achieve a desired learning effect.  These analytical results imply that neurons can learn through reward-modulated STDP to classify not only spatial but also temporal firing patterns of presynaptic neurons.   They also can learn to respond to specific presynaptic firing patterns with particular spike patterns.   Finally, the resulting learning theory predicts that even difficult credit-assignment problems, where it is very hard to tell which synaptic weights should be modified in order to increase the global reward for the system, can be solved in a self-organizing manner through reward-modulated STDP.   This yields an explanation for a fundamental experimental result on biofeedback in monkeys by Fetz and Baker.   In this experiment monkeys were rewarded for increasing the firing rate of a particular neuron in the cortex and were able to solve this extremely difficult credit assignment problem.  ... In addition our model demonstrates that reward-modulated STDP can be applied to all synapses in a large recurrent neural network without endangering the stability of the network dynamics.\"",

In our simulations of parkinsonian conditions, rhythmic inhibition from GPi to the thalamus compromises the ability of thalamocortical relay (TC) cells to respond to depolarizing inputs, such as sensorimotor signals.  High frequency stimulation of STN regularizes GPi firing, and this restores TC responsiveness, despite the increased frequency and amplitude of GPi inhibition to thalamus that result.  We provide a mathematical phase plane analysis of the mechanisms that determine TC relay capabilities in normal, parkinsonian, and DBS states in a reduced model.  This analysis highlights the differences in deinactivation of the low-threshold calcium T -current that we observe in TC cells in these different conditions. ...\"",

In contrast, pharmacologically blocking the delayed rectifier potassium, voltage-gated calcium or Ih, conductance had little effect on dendritic action potential propagation. Optically recorded bAP waveforms were quantified and multicompartmental modeling (NEURON) was used to link the observed behavior with the underlying biophysical properties. The best-fit model included a non-uniform sodium channel distribution with decreasing conductance with distance from the soma, together with a non-uniform (increasing) A-type potassium conductance. AP amplitudes decline with distance in this model, but to a lesser extent than previously thought.

The femur-tibia network was modeled by fitting the responses of model neurons to those obtained in animals. Each implemented neuron has a physiological counterpart. The strengths of 16 interneuronal pathways that integrate sensory input were then assigned three different values and varied independently, generating a database of more than 43 million network variants.

This is a static description and it may be inadequate to interpret neuronal responses to time-varying stimuli.

Further, it was shown that input-noise linearizes and boosts the response bandwidth, and that the interplay between the barrage of noisy synaptic currents and the spike-initiation mechanisms determine the dynamical properties of the firing rate.   In order to allow a reader to explore such simulations, we prepared a simple NEURON implementation of the experiments performed in K\u00f6ndgen et al., 2008 (see also Fourcaud-Trocm\u00e9 al. 2003; Fourcaud-Trocm\u00e9 and Brunel 2005).  In addition, we provide sample MATLAB routines for exploring the sandwich model proposed in K\u00f6ndgen et al., 2008, employing a simple frequdency-domain filtering.  The simulations and the MATLAB routines are based on the linear response properties of layer 5 pyramidal cells estimated by injecting a superposition of a small-amplitude sinusoidal wave and a background noise, as in K\u00f6ndgen et al., 2008.",

However, this bound Ca2+ hypothesis appears to contradict the evidence that  facilitation is reduced by exogenous Ca2+ buffers.   This conclusion led to a widely held view that facilitation must depend solely on the accumulation of Ca2+ in free form.

(J Neurophysiol 96: 3305\u20133313, 2006), observed a novel form of spike timing dependent plasticity (iSTDP) in GABAergic synaptic couplings in layer II of the entorhinal cortex. Depending on the relative timings of the presynaptic input at time tpre and the postsynaptic excitation at time tpost, the synapse is strengthened (delta_t = tpost &#8722; tpre > 0) or weakened (delta_t < 0). The temporal dynamic range of the observed STDP rule was found to lie in the higher gamma frequency band (&#8805;40 Hz), a frequency range important for several vital neuronal tasks. In this paper we study the function of this novel form of iSTDP in the synchronization of the inhibitory neuronal network. In particular we consider a network of two unidirectionally coupled interneurons (UCI) and two mutually coupled interneurons (MCI), in the presence of heterogeneity in the intrinsic firing rates of each coupled neuron. ...\"",

Distinct from the function of Nav1.6 channel, the Nav1.2 channel may control action potential backpropagation because of its high density at the proximal AIS and high threshold. ... In conclusion, distal AIS accumulation of Nav1.6 channels determines the low threshold for action potential initiation; whereas proximal AIS accumulation of Nav1.2 channels sets the threshold for the generation of somatodendritic potentials and ensures action potential backpropagation to the soma and dendrites.

The biological interest of this formal model is illustrated by the persistence of the relevant dynamical features when perturbations are introduced in the model, i.e. dynamic noises and architecture modifications.

        "text": "\"Although previous studies of Huntington\u2019s disease (HD) have addressed many potential mechanisms of striatal neuron dysfunction and death, it is also known based on clinical findings that cortical function is dramatically disrupted in HD. With respect to disease etiology, however, the specific molecular and neuronal circuit bases for the cortical effects of mutant huntingtin (htt) have remained largely unknown.   In the present work we studied the relation between the molecular effects of mutant htt fragments in cortical cells and the corresponding behavior of cortical neuron microcircuits using a novel cellular model of HD. We observed that a transcript-selective diminution in activity-dependent BDNF expression preceded the onset of a synaptic connectivity deficit in ex vivo cortical networks, which manifested as decreased spontaneous collective burst-firing behavior measured by multi-electrode array substrates. Decreased BDNF expression was determined to be a significant contributor to network-level dysfunction, as shown by the ability of exogenous BDNF to ameliorate cortical microcircuit burst firing.   The molecular determinants of the dysregulation of activity-dependent BDNF expression by mutant htt appear to be distinct from previously elucidated mechanisms, as they do not involve known NRSF/REST-regulated promoter sequences, but instead result from dysregulation of BDNF exon IV and VI transcription. These data elucidate a novel HD-related deficit in BDNF gene regulation as a plausible mechanism of cortical neuron hypoconnectivity and cortical function deficits in HD. Moreover, the novel model paradigm established here is well-suited to further mechanistic and drug screening research applications.  A simple mathematical model is proposed to interpret the observations and to explore the impact of specific synaptic dysfunctions on network activity. Interestingly, the model predicts a decrease in synaptic connectivity to be an early effect of mutant huntingtin in cortical neurons, supporting the hypothesis of decreased, rather than increased, synchronized cortical firing in HD.\"",

The model incorporated all major signaling molecules, including dopamine- and cyclic AMP-regulated phosphoprotein with a molecular weight of 32 kDa (DARPP32), as well as AMPA receptor trafficking in the post-synaptic membrane. Simulations with dopamine and calcium inputs reproduced dopamine- and calcium-dependent plasticity.   Further in silico experiments revealed that the positive feedback loop consisted of protein kinase A (PKA), protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the phosphorylation site at threonine 75 of DARPP-32 (Thr75) served as the major switch for inducing LTD and LTP.   The present model elucidated the mechanisms involved in bidirectional regulation of corticostriatal synapses and will allow for further exploration into causes and therapies for dysfunctions such as drug addiction.\"",

Chloride ions accumulation, depletion and diffusion, inside the pipette and the membrane patch, affect by definition the Chloride equilibrium (i.e. Nernst) electrical potential. This in turn changes the ionic driving force underlying GABAa-mediated currents.  It follows that, in case of very small volumes and confined geometries, voltage-clamp recordings of GABAa-receptor currents carry information on both i) Chloride diffusion and ii) receptor kinetics.

We tuned our D1 and D2 receptor MSN models using data from a recent (Moyer et al, 2007) large-scale compartmental model. Our new models capture the input-output relationships for both current injection and spiking input with remarkable accuracy, despite the order of magnitude decrease in system size. They also capture the paired pulse facilitation shown by MSNs. Our dopamine models predict that synaptic effects dominate intrinsic effects for all levels of D1 and D2 receptor activation. Our analytical work on these models predicts that the MSN is never bistable. Nonetheless, these MSN models can produce a spontaneously bimodal membrane potential similar to that recently observed in vitro following application of NMDA agonists. We demonstrate that this bimodality is created by modelling the agonist effects as slow, irregular and massive jumps in NMDA conductance and, rather than a form of bistability, is due to the voltage-dependent blockade of NMDA receptors",

We introduced a novel multiple spike-train analysis method, and apply this to the outputs of the model to find groups of synchronised neurons at multiple time-scales. We found that, with realistic in vivo background input, small assemblies of synchronised MSNs spontaneously appeared, consistent with experimental observations, and that the number of assemblies and the time-scale of synchronisation was strongly dependent on the simulated concentration of dopamine. We also showed that feed-forward inhibition from the FSIs counter-intuitively increases the firing rate of the MSNs.",

By contrast, the compartmental model introduced in this article assigns a potential to each end of a segment, and takes into account the location of input to a segment on the model solution by partitioning the effect of this input between the axial currents at the proximal and distal boundaries of segments.  For a given neuron, the new and traditional approaches to compartmental modelling use the same number of locations at which the membrane potential is to be determined, and lead to ordinary differential equations that are structurally identical. However, the solution achieved by the new approach gives an order of magnitude better accuracy and precision than that achieved by the latter in the presence of point process input.",

We generated a good match of our simulations with DCN current clamp data we recorded in acute slices, including the heterogeneity in the rebound responses. We then examined how inhibitory and excitatory synaptic input interacted with these intrinsic conductances to control DCN firing. We found that the output spiking of the model reflected the ongoing balance of excitatory and inhibitory input rates and that changing the level of inhibition performed an additive operation. Rebound firing following strong Purkinje cell input bursts was also possible, but only if the chloride reversal potential was more negative than -70 mV to allow de-inactivation of rebound currents. Fast rebound bursts due to T-type calcium current and slow rebounds due to persistent sodium current could be differentially regulated by synaptic input, and the pattern of these rebounds was further influenced by HCN current. Our findings suggest that active properties of DCN neurons could play a crucial role for signal processing in the cerebellum.",

It is not obvious, however, how a pyramidal cell in such a network could control its output when action potentials are free to propagate from the axons of other pyramidal cells into its own axon. We address this problem by means of simulations based on 3D reconstructions of pyramidal cells from rat somatosensory cortex. We show that somatic depolarization enables propagation via gap junctions into the initial segment and main axon, while somatic hyperpolarization disables it. We show further that somatic voltage cannot effectively control action potential propagation through gap junctions on minor collaterals; action potentials may therefore propagate freely from such collaterals regardless of somatic voltage. In previous work, VFOs are all but abolished during the hyperpolarization phase of slow-oscillations induced by anesthesia in vivo. This finding constrains the density of gap junctions on collaterals in our model and suggests that axonal sprouting due to cortical lesions may result in abnormally high gap junction density on collaterals, leading in turn to excessive VFO activity and hence to epilepsy via kindling.",

From these, we found the probabilities of intersection between the neurites of two neurons given their inter-somatic distance, and used these to construct three-dimensional striatal networks. These networks were examined for their predictions for the distributions of the numbers and distances of connections for all the connections in the microcircuit. We then combined the neuron models from a previous model (Humphries et al, 2009; ModelDB ID: 128874) with the new anatomical model. We used this new complete striatal model to examine the impact of the anatomical network on the firing properties of the MSN and FSI populations, and to study the influence of all the inputs to one MSN within the network.",

        "text": "Many animals use a form of dead reckoning known as 'path integration' to maintain a sense of their location as they explore the world. However, internal motion signals and the neural activity that integrates them can be noisy, leading inevitably to inaccurate position estimates. The rat hippocampus and entorhinal cortex support a flexible system of spatial representation that is critical to spatial learning and memory. The position signal encoded by this system is thought to rely on path integration, but it must be recalibrated by familiar landmarks to maintain accuracy. To explore the interaction between path integration and external landmarks, we present a model of hippocampal activity based on the interference of theta-frequency oscillations that are modulated by realistic animal movements around a track. We show that spatial activity degrades with noise, but introducing external cues based on direct sensory feedback can prevent this degradation. When these cues are put into conflict with each other, their interaction produces a diverse array of response changes that resembles experimental observations. Feedback driven by attending to landmarks may be critical to navigation and spatial memory in mammals.",

Starting from the experimentally supported assumption on hippocampal neurons we explore an experimentally testable prediction at the single neuron level. The model shows how and to what extent a pathological hypofunction of a contextdependent distal input on a CA1 neuron can generate hallucinations by altering the normal recall of objects on which the neuron has been previously tuned.

ABSTRACT \"... We propose that these findings are tightly linked: using a network model, we show that slower synapses are essential to counterbalance hyperconnectivity in order to maintain a dynamic range of excitatory activity. However, the slow synaptic time constants induce decreased responsiveness to low frequency stimulation, which may explain deficits in integration and information processing in attentional neuronal networks in neurodevelopmental disorders.\"",

This includes a physiological window of induction and natural patterns of spike discharge. An INa+ component at 2-20 ms was particularly important, even though it represented only a tiny fraction of overall INa+ amplitude. With the addition of a delayed rectifier IK+ the singlet firing seen in some DRG neurons can also be simulated.

To quantitatively address this question, we developed detailed passive cable models of BCs in the dentate gyrus based on dual somatic or somatodendritic recordings and complete morphologic reconstructions.   Both specific membrane capacitance and axial resistivity were comparable to those of pyramidal neurons, but the average somatodendritic specific membrane resistance (R(m)) was substantially lower in BCs.   Furthermore, R(m) was markedly nonuniform, being lowest in soma and proximal dendrites, intermediate in distal dendrites, and highest in the axon.  ... Further computational analysis revealed that these unique cable properties accelerate the time course of synaptic potentials at the soma in response to fast inputs, while boosting the efficacy of slow distal inputs.

Among these processes is cerebellar long-term depression (LTD), a form of synaptic plasticity expressed as a reduction in the number of synaptic AMPA receptors (AMPARs) in Purkinje cells. Using a stochastic model of the signaling network and mechanisms of AMPAR trafficking involved in LTD, we show that the network activity in single synapses switches between two discrete stable states (LTD and non-LTD). Stochastic fluctuations affecting more intensely the level of activity of a few components of the network lead to the probabilistic induction of LTD and threshold dithering. The non-uniformly distributed stochasticity of the network allows the stable occurrence of several different macroscopic levels of depression, determining the experimentally observed sigmoidal relationship between the magnitude of depression and the concentration of the triggering signal.",

Through analytic and computational methods, we find points of stable phase-locking for a neuron with plastic input synapses.

However, its effects on the ionic mechanisms remains incompletely understood.   Objectives: We aimed to investigate EUG`s effects on neuronal ionic currents and excitability, especially on voltage-gated ion currents, and to verify the effects on a hyperexcitability-temporal lobe seizure model.   Methods: With the aid of patch-clamp technology, we first investigated the effects of EUG on ionic currents in NG108-15 neuronal cells differentiated with cyclic AMP. We then used modified Pinsky-Rinzel simulation modeling to evaluate its effects on spontaneous action potentials (APs).   Finally, we investigated its effects on pilocarpine-induced seizures in rats.   Results: EUG depressed the transient and late components of INa in the neurons.   It not only increased the degree of INa inactivation, but specifically suppressed the non-inactivating INa (INa(NI)).   ... In addition, EUG diminished L-type Ca2+ current and delayed rectifier K+ current only at higher concentrations. EUG`s effects on APs frequency reduction was verified by the simulation modeling.   In pilocarpine-induced seizures, the EUG-treated rats showed no shorter seizure latency but a lower seizure severity and mortality than the control rats.   ... Conclusion: The synergistic blocking effects of INa and INa(NI) contributes to the main mechanism through which EUG affects the firing of neuronal APs and modulate neuronal hyperexcitability such as pilocarpine-induced temporal lobe seizures.\"",

The principle of abstraction is explained through chapters on simplifying models, and how simplified models can be used in networks. This theme is continued in a final chapter on modeling the development of the nervous system. Requiring an elementary background in neuroscience and some high school mathematics, this textbook is an ideal basis for a course on computational neuroscience.\"",

To estimate the potential contributions of PIC (Persistent Inward Current) activation and synaptic input patterns to motor unit discharge patterns, we examined the responses of a set of cable motoneuron models to different patterns of excitatory and inhibitory inputs.  The models were first tuned to approximate the current- and voltage-clamp responses of low- and medium-threshold spinal motoneurons studied in decerebrate cats and then driven with different patterns of excitatory and inhibitory inputs.  The responses of the models to excitatory inputs reproduced a number of features of human motor unit discharge.  However, the pattern of rate modulation was strongly influenced by the temporal and spatial pattern of concurrent inhibitory inputs.  Thus, even though PIC activation is likely to exert a strong influence on firing rate modulation, PIC activation in combination with different patterns of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs can produce a wide variety of motor unit discharge patterns.\"",

We propose and test a minimalist competition-based feed-forward neuronal model capable of detecting a certain ratio of pheromone components independently of overall concentration. This model represents an elementary recognition unit for binary mixtures which we propose is entirely contained in the macroglomerular complex (MGC) of the male moth. A set of such units, along with projection neurons (PNs), can provide the input to higher brain centres. We found that (1) accuracy is mainly achieved by maintaining a certain ratio of connection strengths between olfactory receptor neurons (ORN) and local neurons (LN), much less by properties of the interconnections between the competing LNs proper. (2) successful ratio recognition is achieved using latency-to-first-spike in the LN populations which. (3) longer durations of the competition process between LNs did not result in higher recognition accuracy.",

Model init_ring.hoc shows that spike failure result in reentrant oscillations of a spike in a loop of axons connected by gap junctions, where one gap junction is weak.  The paper shows that in random networks of axons connected by gap junctions, oscillations are driven by single pacemaker loop of axons. The shortest loop, around which a spike can travel, is the most likely pacemaker. This principle allows us to predict the frequency of oscillations from network connectivity and visa versa.

Using this detailed single neuron model, it is investigated the conditions under which individual CA1 pyramidal neurons process incoming information in a complex (non-linear) as opposed to a passive (linear) manner. This detailed compartmental model of a CA1 pyramidal neuron is based on one described previously (Poirazi, 2003). The model was adapted to five different reconstructed morphologies for this study, and slightly modified to fit the experimental data of (Losonczy, 2006), and to incorporate evidence in pyramidal neurons for the non-saturation of NMDA receptor-mediated conductances by single glutamate pulses. We first replicate the main findings of (Losonczy, 2006), including the very brief window for nonlinear integration using single-pulse stimuli. We then show that double-pulse stimuli increase a CA1 pyramidal neuron\u2019s tolerance for input asynchrony by at last an order of magnitude. Therefore, it is shown using this model, that the time window for nonlinear integration is extended by more than an order of magnitude when inputs are short bursts as opposed to single spikes.",

That background activity affects multiple aspects of neuronal and network function. However, its effect on the induction of spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) is not clear. Using the present biophysically-detailed computational model, it is not only able to replicate the conductance-dependent shunting of dendritic potentials (Delgado et al,2010), but show that synaptic background can truncate calcium dynamics within dendritic spines, in a way that affects potentiation more strongly than depression. This program uses a simplified layer 2/3 pyramidal neuron constructed in NEURON. It was similar to the model of Traub et al., J Neurophysiol. (2003), and consisted of a soma, an apical shaft, distal dendrites, five basal dendrites, an axon, and a single spine. The spine\u2019s location was variable along the apical shaft (initial 50 &#956;m) and apical. The axon contained an axon hillock region, an initial segment, segments with myelin, and nodes of Ranvier, in order to have realistic action potential generation.

Three-dimensional reconstructions of V1 and dlPFC neurons were incorporated into computational models containing Hodgkin-Huxley and AMPA- and GABAA-receptor gated channels. Morphology alone largely accounted for observed passive physiological properties, but led to AP firing rates that differed more than observed empirically, and to synaptic responses that opposed empirical results. Accordingly, modeling predicts that active channel conductances differ between V1 and dlPFC neurons. The unique features of V1 and dlPFC neurons are likely fundamental determinants of area-specific network behavior. The compact electrotonic arbor and increased excitability of V1 neurons support the rapid signal integration required for early processing of visual information. The greater connectivity and dendritic complexity of dlPFC neurons likely support higher level cognitive functions including working memory and planning.",

The model captures the experimentally observed role of neurogenesis in perceptual learning and the enhanced response of young granule cells to novel stimuli. Moreover, it makes specific predictions for the type of odor enrichment that should be effective in enhancing the ability of animals to discriminate similar odor mixtures. NSF grant DMS-0719944.",

Though such effects have been demonstrated in single cells, there are no studies that examine how such mechanisms may lead to the effects of dopamine at a neural network level. In this study, we investigated the effects of dopamine on synchronization in two simulated neural networks; one biophysical model composed of Wang-Buzsaki neurons and a reduced model with theta neurons. In both models, we show that parametrically varying the levels of dopamine, modeled through the changes in the excitability of interneurons, reveals an inverted-U shaped relationship, with low gamma band power at both low and high dopamine levels and optimal synchronization at intermediate levels. Moreover, such a relationship holds when the external input is both tonic and periodic at gamma band range. Together, our results indicate that dopamine can modulate cortical gamma band synchrony in an inverted-U fashion and that the physiologic effects of dopamine on single fast-spiking interneurons can give rise to such non-monotonic effects at the network level.",

The second model revealed that the presence of the electroosmotic flow made the time of fluorescence recovery dependent on the position of the bleaching spot relative to cellular membrane.",

In response to mossy fiber bursts, synaptic weights at multiple connections played a crucial role to regulate spike number and positioning in granule cells. Interestingly, different combinations of synaptic weights optimized either first-spike timing precision or spike number, efficiently controlling transmission and filtering properties. These results predict that distributed synaptic plasticity regulates the emission of quasi-digital spike patterns on the millisecond time scale and allows the cerebellar granular layer to flexibly control burst transmission along the mossy fiber pathway.",

Next, we infer the model parameters using experimental data from three different neocortical excitatory connection types.

The robot used a three-joint arm and performed repetitive fast manipulations with different masses along an 8-shape trajectory. In accordance with biological evidence, the cerebellum model was endowed with both LTD and LTP at the PF-PC, MF-DCN and PC-DCN synapses. This resulted in a network scheme whose effectiveness was extended considerably compared to one including just PF-PC synaptic plasticity. Indeed, the system including distributed plasticity reliably self-adapted to manipulate different masses and to learn the arm-object dynamics over a time course that included fast learning and consolidation, along the lines of what has been observed in behavioral tests. In particular, PF-PC plasticity operated as a time correlator between the actual input state and the system error, while MF-DCN and PC-DCN plasticity played a key role in generating the gain controller. This model suggests that distributed synaptic plasticity allows generation of the complex learning properties of the cerebellum.",

The classical long-term synaptic plasticity between parallel fibers (PFs) and Purkinje cells (PCs), which is driven by the inferior olive (IO), can only account for limited aspects of learning. Recently, the role of additional forms of plasticity in the granular layer, molecular layer and deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) has been considered. In particular, learning at DCN synapses allows for generalization, but convergence to a stable state requires hundreds of repetitions. In this paper we have explored the putative role of the IO-DCN connection by endowing it with adaptable weights and exploring its implications in a closed-loop robotic manipulation task. Our results show that IO-DCN plasticity accelerates convergence of learning by up to two orders of magnitude without conflicting with the generalization properties conferred by DCN plasticity. Thus, this model suggests that multiple distributed learning mechanisms provide a key for explaining the complex properties of procedural learning and open up new experimental questions for synaptic plasticity in the cerebellar network.",

In vivo electrophysiological data have shown that a prior depolarization of SONs induced a short-term (1 sec)increase in their membrane excitability, which facilitated the ability of corticostriatal synaptic potentials to induce firing. Here we propose, using a computational model of SONs, that the use-dependent, short-term increase in the responsiveness of SONs mainly results from the slow kinetics of a voltage-dependent, slowly inactivating potassium A-current. This mechanism confers on SONs a form of intrinsic short-term memory that optimizes the synaptic input\u00e2\u20ac\u201coutput relationship as a function of their past activation.",

However, not much is known about how CREB-dependent neuronal alterations in synaptic strength, excitability and LTP can boost memory formation in the complex architecture of a neuronal network. Using a model of a CA1 microcircuit, we investigate whether hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neuron properties altered by increasing CREB activity may contribute to improve memory storage and recall. With a set of patterns presented to a network, we find that the pattern recall quality under AD-like conditions is significantly better when boosting CREB function with respect to control. The results are robust and consistent upon increasing the synaptic damage expected by AD progression, supporting the idea that the use of CREB-based therapies could provide a new approach to treat AD.",

In this work, we have combined stochastic computational modeling and  a systematic pharmacological study of different signaling pathways to  investigate their impact during short-term adaptation (STA).  ... These results suggest that G-coupled  receptors (GPCRs) cycling is involved with the occurrence of STA. To  gain insights on the dynamical aspects of this process, we developed  a stochastic computational model. The model consists of the olfactory  transduction currents mediated by the cyclic nucleotide gated (CNG)  channels and calcium ion (Ca2+)-activated chloride (CAC) channels,  and the dynamics of their respective ligands, cAMP and Ca2+, and it  simulates the EOG (electroolfactogram) results obtained under different experimental  conditions through changes in the amplitude and duration of cAMP and  Ca2+ response, two second messengers implicated with STA  occurrence. The model reproduced the experimental data for each  pharmacological treatment and provided a mechanistic explanation for  the action of GPCR cycling in the levels of second messengers  modulating the levels of STA. All together, these experimental and  theoretical results indicate the existence of a mechanism of  regulation of STA by signaling pathways that control GPCR cycling and  tune the levels of second messengers in OSNs, and not only by CNG  channel desensitization as previously thought. \"",

We also compared properties of DRt neurons with those in the adjacent parvicellular reticular nucleus (PCRt) and in neighboring regions outside the reticular formation. We found that neurons in the DRt and PCRt had similar electrophysiological properties and exhibited mostly tonic-like firing patterns, whereas neurons outside the reticular formation showed a larger diversity of firing-patterns. The dominance of tonic neurons in the DRt supports previous conclusions that these neurons encode stimulus intensity through their firing frequency.",

Contrary to rate comodulation, spike-time synchronization is unaffected by firing rate, thus enabling synchrony- and rate-based coding to operate independently.  The type of output correlation depends on whether intrinsic neuron properties promote integration or coincidence detection: \u201cideal\u201d integrators (with spike generation sensitive to stimulus mean) exhibit rate comodulation, whereas ideal coincidence detectors (with spike generation sensitive to stimulus variance) exhibit precise spike-time synchronization.  \u2026  Our results explain how different types of correlations arise based on how individual neurons generate spikes, and why spike-time synchronization and rate comodulation can encode different stimulus properties.  Our results also highlight the importance of neuronal properties for population-level coding insofar as neural networks can employ different coding schemes depending on the dominant operating mode of their constituent neurons. \u201c",

These oscillations have often been studied in mathematical models by splitting the equations into fast and slow subsystems.  Typically, one treats the slow variables as parameters of the fast subsystem and studies the bifurcation structure of this subsystem.  This has key features such as a z-curve (stationary branch) and a Hopf bifurcation that gives rise to a branch of periodic spiking solutions.  In models of bursting in pituitary cells, we have recently used a different approach that focuses on the dynamics of the slow subsystem.  Characteristic features of this approach are folded node singularities and a critical manifold. \u2026  We find that the z-curve and Hopf bifurcation of the twofast/ one-slow decomposition are closely related to the voltage nullcline and folded node singularity of the one-fast/two-slow decomposition, respectively. They become identical in the double singular limit in which voltage is infinitely fast and calcium is infinitely slow.\"",

Recently, we identified presence of extrasynaptic tonic GABA currents in FS-BCs and showed that experimentally-induced seizures enhance extrasynaptic tonic GABA currents and render GABA reversal potential (EGABA) depolarizing (Yu et al., 2013). Extrasynaptic GABA currents are mediated by extra- and peri-synaptically located GABAARs and can contribute to synaptic decay kinetics. Additionally, shunting rather than hyperpolarizing EGABA has been shown to increase the frequency and reduce coherence of network oscillations. Using homogeneous networks of biophysically-based, multi-compartmental model FS-BCs, we examined how the presence of extrasynaptic GABA currents and the experimentally identified seizure-induced alterations in GABA currents and EGABA modify the frequency and coherence of network firing.",

Recently, we identified that one week after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus, dentate fast-spiking basket cells (FS-BCs), which underlie fast perisomatic inhibition, show two distinct changes in inhibition: (1) enhanced tonic currents (IGABA) and (2)depolarizing shift in GABA reversal (EGABA) following SE. These two changes can have opposing effects on neuronal inhibition with increases in tonic GABA conductance (gGABA) reducing excitability when the GABA currents are shunting (or hyperpolarizing) and potentially enhancing excitability when GABA currents are depolarizing. The following model is used to examine the post-SE changes in tonic GABA conductance, together with the depolarized GABA reversal potential modify FS-BC excitability and dentate network activity.",

In addition, oscillation amplitude may fluctuate over time. Interactions between oscillatory networks may contribute, but their effects are poorly known. Here, we created a two model networks, one generating on its own a relatively slow frequency (slow network) and one generating a fast frequency (fast network). We chose the slow or the fast network as source network projecting feed-forward connections to the other, or target network, and systematically investigated how type and strength of inter-network connections affected target network activity. Our results strongly depended on three factors: the type of the relevant (main) connection, its strength and the amount of source synapses. For high inter-network connection strengths, we found that the source network could completely impose its rhythm on the target network. Interestingly, the slow network was more effective at imposing its rhythm on the fast network than the other way around. The strongest entrainment occurred when excitatory cells of the slow network projected to excitatory or inhibitory cells of the fast network. Just as observed in rat activity at the prefrontal cortex satisfies the behavior described above, such that together, our results suggest that input from other oscillating networks may markedly alter a network\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s frequency spectrum and may partly be responsible for the rich repertoire of temporal oscillation patterns observed in the brain.",

In this paper, we investigate the possibility that the experimental protocols on synaptic plasticity  may result in different consequences (e.g., LTD instead of LTP), according to the initial conditions of the stimulated synapses, and can generate confusing results. Using biophysical models of synaptic plasticity and hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, we study how, why, and to what extent EPSPs observed at the soma after induction of LTP/LTD reflects the actual (local) synaptic state. The model and the results suggest a physiologically plausible explanation of why LTD induction is experimentally difficult, and they offer experimentally testable predictions on the stimulation protocols that may be more effective.",

The dynamics is therefore limited to a time scale of milliseconds, which is determined by the membrane capacitance multiplied by the resistance of the ion channels, and by the gating time constants. This model includes slow dynamics in an extended HH framework that simulates time-dependent ion concentrations, pumps, and buffers. Fluxes across the neuronal membrane change intra- and extracellular ion concentrations, whereby the latter can also change through contact to reservoirs in the surroundings. The dynamics on three distinct slow times scales is determined by the cell volume-to-surface-area ratio and the membrane permeability (seconds), the buffer time constants (tens of seconds), and the slower backward buffering (minutes to hours). The modulatory dynamics and the newly emerging excitable dynamics corresponds to pathological conditions observed in epileptiform burst activity, and spreading depression in migraine aura and stroke, respectively.",

At least two modes of Ca2+ wave spread have been suggested: a continuous mode based on presumed relative homogeneity of ER within the cell; and a pseudo-saltatory model where Ca2+ regeneration occurs at discrete points with diffusion between them.   We compared the effects of three patterns of hypothesized IP3 R distribution: 1. continuous homogeneous ER, 2. hotspots with increased IP3R density (IP3 R hotspots), 3. areas of increased ER density (ER stacks). All three modes produced Ca2+ waves with velocities similar to those measured in vitro (~50 - 90\u00b5m /sec). ...  The measures were sensitive to changes in density and spacing of IP3 R hotspots and stacks. ... An extended electrochemical model, including voltage gated calcium channels and AMPA synapses, demonstrated that membrane priming via AMPA stimulation enhances subsequent Ca2+ wave amplitude and duration. Our modeling suggests that pharmacological targeting of IP3 Rs and SERCA could allow modulation of Ca2+ wave propagation in diseases where Ca2+ dysregulation has been implicated.  \"",

We found that SK channels are the main determinants of the mAHP, in contrast to CA1 pyramidal cells where the mAHP is primarily caused by the opening of M channels. The model reproduced these experimental results, but we were unable to reproduce the effects of the M-channel blocker XE991 on the sAHP. It is suggested that either the XE991-sensitive component of the sAHP is not due to M channels, or that when contributing to the sAHP, these channels operate in a mode different from that associated with the mAHP.",

This means that certain connectivity motifs occur at a higher frequency than would be expected by chance. Of particular interest, short-term synaptic plasticity properties were found to colocalize with specific motifs: an over-expression of bidirectional motifs has been found in neuronal pairs where short-term facilitation dominates synaptic transmission among the neurons, whereas an over-expression of unidirectional motifs has been observed in neuronal pairs where short-term depression dominates. In previous work we found that, given a network with fixed short-term properties, the interaction between short- and long-term plasticity of synaptic transmission is sufficient for the emergence of specific motifs. Here, we introduce an error-driven learning mechanism for short-term plasticity that may explain how such observed correspondences develop from randomly initialized dynamic synapses. ...\"",

We tested a hypothesis proposed for its role in sensory information processing: Intrinsic DMN activity facilitates neural responses to sensory input. A neural network model, consisting of a sensory network (Nsen) and a DMN, was simulated. The Nsen contained cell assemblies. Each cell assembly comprised principal cells, GABAergic interneurons (Ia, Ib), and glial cells. We let the Nsen carry out a perceptual task: detection of sensory stimuli. \u2026 This enabled the Nsen to reliably detect the stimulus. We suggest that intrinsic default model network activity may accelerate the reaction speed of the sensory network by modulating its ongoing-spontaneous activity in a subthreshold manner. Ambient GABA contributes to achieve an optimal ongoing spontaneous subthreshold neuronal state, in which GABAergic gliotransmission triggered by the intrinsic default model network activity may play an important role.",

To examine this possibility, we formulated a simple model of the cerebellum with a minimal number of components based on its known anatomy and physiology, implementing both LTD and long-term potentiation (LTP) at PF-PC synapses and mossy fiber-vestibular nuclear neuron (MF-VN) synapses.

Our results unify several prior findings regarding HFO mechanisms, and also make several new predictions regarding abnormal HFOs. We show that HFOs are generic, emergent phenomena whose characteristics reflect a wide range of connectivity and network input. Although produced by different mechanisms, both normal and abnormal HFOs generate similar ripple frequencies, underscoring that peak frequency is unable to distinguish the two. Abnormal ripples are generic phenomena that arise when input to pyramidal cells overcomes network inhibition, resulting in high-frequency, uncoordinated firing. In addition, fast ripples transiently and sporadically arise from the precise conditions that produce abnormal ripples. Lastly, we show that such abnormal conditions do not require any specific network structure to produce coherent HFOs, as even completely asynchronous activity is capable of producing abnormal ripples and fast ripples in this manner. These results provide a generic, network-based explanation for the link between pathological ripples and fast ripples, and a unifying description for the entire spectrum from normal ripples to pathological fast ripples.\"",

The coupled oscillator model implemented with Wang\u2013Buzsaki model neurons is not sufficiently robust to heterogeneity in excitatory drive, and therefore intrinsic frequency, to account for in vitro models of ING. Similarly, in a tightly synchronized regime, the stochastic population oscillator model is often characterized by sparse firing, whereas interneurons both in vivo and in vitro do not fire sparsely during gamma,but rather on average every other cycle. We substituted so-called resonator neural models, which exhibit class 2 excitability and postinhibitory rebound (PIR), for the integrators that are typically used. This results in much greater robustness to heterogeneity that actually increases as the average participation in spikes per cycle approximates physiological levels.

Thus, we derived a complete model of dopamine and spike-timing dependent cortico-striatal plasticity from in vitro data. We then showed this model produces the predicted activity changes necessary for learning and extinction in an operant task. Moreover, we showed the complex dependencies of cortico-striatal plasticity are not only sufficient but necessary for learning and extinction. The model was validated in a wider setting of action selection in basal ganglia, showing how it could account for behavioural data describing extinction, renewal, and reacquisition, and replicate in vitro experimental data on cortico-striatal plasticity.  The code supplied here allows reproduction of the proposed process of learning in medium spiny neurons, giving the results of Figure 7 of the paper.",

We show that spike-timing-dependent plasticity with both pre- and postsynaptic expression develops receptive fields with reduced variability and improved discriminability compared to postsynaptic plasticity alone. These long-term modifications in receptive field statistics match recent sensory perception experiments. In these simulations we demonstrate that learning with this form of plasticity leaves a hidden postsynaptic memory trace that enables fast relearning of previously stored information, providing a cellular substrate for memory savings. Our results reveal essential roles for presynaptic plasticity that are missed when only postsynaptic expression of long-term plasticity is considered, and suggest an experience-dependent distribution of pre- and postsynaptic strength changes.",

The H-current is a slow, hyperpolarization-activated, depolarizing current that contributes to neuronal resonance and membrane potential.  We characterized amplitude fluctuations in network oscillations by measuring  the average durations of HAEs and LAEs, and explored how these were modulated by trains of external spikes, both in  the presence and absence of H-channels.   We looked at HAE duration, the frequency and power of network oscillations, and the effect of H-channels on the temporal voltage profile in single cells.  We found that H-currents increased the oscillation frequency and, in combination with external spikes, representing input from areas outside the network, strongly decreased the synchrony of firing. As a consequence, the oscillation power and the duration of episodes during which the network exhibited high-amplitude oscillations were greatly reduced in the presence of H-channels.",

We use a computational model based on a Hodgkin-Huxley framework which includes neural spiking dynamics, processes of ion accumulation, and homeostatic mechanisms like vascular coupling and Na/K-exchange pumps. We show that a large extracellular space (ECS) explains the recovery failure in high brain regions. A phase-space analysis shows that with a large ECS recovery from AD through potassium regulation is impossible. The code 'time_series.ode' can be used to simulate AD for a large and a small ECS and show the different behaviors. The code \u2018continuations.ode\u2019 can be used to show the fixed point structure.

To ensure the stability of these traces in the presence of further learning, however, a regulation of plasticity appears beneficial. Here, we take up the recent suggestion that dendritic inhibition can switch plasticity of excitatory synapses on and off by gating backpropagating action potentials (bAPs) and calcium spikes, i.e., by gating the coincidence signals required for Hebbian forms of plasticity. We analyze temporal and spatial constraints of such a gating and investigate whether it is possible to suppress bAPs without a simultaneous annihilation of the forward-directed information flow via excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs).

        "text": "The endocannabinoid (eCB) system is considered involved in synaptic depression. Recent reports have also linked eCBs to synaptic potentiation. However it is not known how eCB signaling may support such bidirectionality. To question the mechanisms of this phenomena in spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) at corticostriatal synapses, we combined electrophysiology experiments with biophysical modeling. We demonstrate that STDP is controlled by eCB levels and dynamics: prolonged and moderate levels of eCB lead to eCB-mediated long-term depression (eCB-tLTD) while short and large eCB transients produce eCB-mediated long-term potentiation (eCB-tLTP). Therefore, just like neurotransmitters glutamate or GABA, eCB form a bidirectional system.",

We examined synaptic connectivity between molecularly defined inhibitory interneurons and CA1 pyramidal cell dendrites using correlative light-electron microscopy and large-volume array tomography. We show that interneurons can be highly selective in their connectivity to specific dendritic branch types and, furthermore, exhibit precisely targeted connectivity to the origin or end of individual branches. Computational simulations indicate that the observed subcellular targeting enables control over the nonlinear integration of synaptic input or the initiation and backpropagation of action potentials in a branchselective manner. Our results demonstrate that connectivity between interneurons and pyramidal cell dendrites is more precise and spatially segregated than previously appreciated, which may be a critical determinant of how inhibition shapes dendritic computation.\"",

We find that spike initiation depends on both location and amount of input, as well as the intrinsic properties of the interneuron. Distal synaptic input always produces strong back-propagating spikes whereas proximal input could produce both forward and back-propagating spikes depending on the input strength.

The descriptions of these currents and their modulation were based largely on voltageclamp data from sensory neurons. Simulations were preformed with the program SNNAP (Simulator for Neural Networks and Action Potentials). The model was sufficient to replicate empirical data that describes the membrane currents, action potential waveform and excitability as well as their modulation by application of 5-HT, increased levels of adenosine cyclic monophosphate or application of active phorbol esters. The results provide several predictions that warrant additional experimental investigation and illustrate the importance of considering indirect as well as direct effects of modulatory agents on the modulation of membrane currents.

Intracellular stimulation of sensory neurons to fire a burst of action potentials at 10 Hz for 1 sec led to significant homosynaptic depression of postsynaptic responses.  During the burst, the steady-state depressed phase of the postsynaptic response, which was only 20% of the initial EPSP of the burst, still contributed to firing the motor neuron. To explore the functional contribution of transient homosynaptic depression to the response of the motor neuron, computer simulations of the sensorimotor synapse with and without depression were compared. Depression allowed the motor neuron to produce graded responses over a wide range of presynaptic input strength.  Thus, synaptic depression increased the dynamic range of the sensorimotor synapse and can, in principle, have a profound effect on information processing.

Effects of monosynaptic circuitry were examined by the use of a two-layer network model with four sensory neurons in the input layer and one motor neuron in the output layer. Results of these simulations indicated that the monosynaptic circuit could not account fully for long-duration responses of tail motor neurons elicited by tail stimulation. A three-layer network model was constructed by interposing a layer of two excitatory interneurons between the input and output layers of the two-layer network model. The three-layer model could account for long-duration responses in motor neurons. Sensory neurons are a known site of plasticity in Aplysia. Synaptic plasticity at more than one locus modified dramatically the input-output relationship of the three-layer network model. This feature gave the model redundancy in its plastic properties and points to the possibility of distributed memory in the circuitry mediating withdrawal reflexes in Aplysia.

Experimental evidence suggests that a rapidly inactivating K+ current (I(KIF)) plays a critical role in generating these discharge patterns. To explore the role of I(KIF), we used a computational model based on the biophysical data. The model replicated the dependence of the discharge pattern on the magnitude and duration of hyperpolarizing prepulses, and I(KIF) was necessary to convey this dependence. Experimentally, half-inactivation voltage and kinetics of I(KIF) show wide variability. Varying these parameters in the model ... suggests that pyramidal cells can adjust their sensitivity to different temporal patterns of inhibition and excitation by modulating the kinetics of I(KIF). Overall, I(KIF) is a critical conductance controlling the excitability of DCN pyramidal cells.  (See readme.txt and paper for details).

Current- and voltage-clamp analyses were performed on cultured Kenyon cells from honeybees. ... Voltage-clamp analyses characterized a fast transient Na+ current (INa), a delayed rectifier K+ current (IK,V) and a fast transient K+ current (IK,A). Using the neurosimulator SNNAP, a Hodgkin-Huxley type model was developed and used to investigate the roles of the different currents during spiking. The model led to the prediction of a slow transient outward current (IK,ST) that was subsequently identified by reevaluating the voltage-clamp data. Simulations indicated that the primary currents that underlie spiking are INa and IK,V, whereas IK,A and IK,ST primarily determined the responsiveness of the model to stimuli such constant or oscillatory injections of current.

        "text": "Bursts of spikes in leech T cells produce an AHP, which results from activation of a Na+/K+ pump and  a Ca2+-dependent K+ current.  Activity-dependent increases in the AHP are believed to induce conduction  block of spikes in several regions of the neuron, which in turn, may decrease presynaptic invasion of spikes and  thereby decrease transmitter release.  To explore this possibility, we used the neurosimulator SNNAP to develop  a multi-compartmental model of the T cell.  Each compartment was modeled as an equivalent electrical circuit,  in which some currents were regulated by intracellular Ca2+ and Na+. The membrane model consisted of  a membrane capacitance (Cm), for which we used the value 1 uF/cm2, in parallel with  two inward currents (Na+ and Ca2+), two K+ currents, a leak current and pump current.  The model incorporated empirical data that describe the geometry of the cell and activity-dependent changes of the AHP (see paper for details).   Simulations indicated that at some branching points, activity-dependent increases of the AHP reduced the number  of spikes transmitted from the minor receptive field to the soma and beyond.   These results suggest that the AHP can regulate spike conduction within the presynaptic arborizations of the cell and  could in principle contribute to the synaptic depression that is correlated with increases in the AHP.",

This study investigates the effects of acetyl-L-carnitine in T segmental sensory neurons of the leech Hirudo  medicinalis. These neurons are involved in some forms of neural plasticity associated with learning processes.  Their physiological firing is accompanied by a large afterhyperpolarization that is mainly due to the Na+/K+ ATPase  activity and partially to a Ca2+-dependent K+ current. A clear-cut hyperpolarization and a significant increase of the  afterhyperpolarization have been recorded in T neurons of leeches injected with 2 mM acetyl-L-carnitine some days  before. Acute treatments of 50 mM acetyl-L-carnitine induced similar effects in T cells of naive animals.  Moreover, in these cells, widely arborized, the afterhyperpolarization seems to play an important role in determining  the action potential transmission at neuritic bifurcations.  A computational model of a T cell has been previously developed considering detailed data for geometry and the  modulation of the pump current. Herein, we showed that to a larger afterhyperpolarization, due to the  acetyl-L-carnitine-induced effects, corresponds a decrement in the number of action potentials  reaching synaptic terminals.",

The differential equations of a simple equivalent circuit for the fiber are dealt with by means of some of the mathematical techniques of nonlinear mechanics. General features of the system are (a) a propensity to produce damped or sustained oscillations over a rather broad parameter range, and (b) considerable latitude in the shape of the oscillatory potentials. It is concluded that for cells subject to changeable parameters (either from cell to cell or with time during cellular activity), a system dominated by two noninactivating conductances can exhibit varied oscillatory and bistable behavior.

The delay in IP3 increase caused by the PF metabotropic pathway generated the optimal PF\u2013CF interval. The Ca dynamics revealed a threshold for large Ca2 release that decreased as IP3 increased, and it coherently explained the different forms of LTD.  See paper for more and details.",

Within a few tens of milliseconds after the start of random mossy fiber input, the populations of Golgi and granule cells became entrained in a single synchronous oscillation, the basic frequency of which ranged from 10 to 40 Hz depending on the average rate of firing in the mossy fiber population. ... The synchronous, rhythmic firing pattern was robust over a broad range of biologically realistic parameter values and to parameter randomization. Three conditions, however, made the oscillations more transient and could desynchronize the entire network in the end: a very low mossy fiber activity, a very dominant excitation of Golgi cells through mossy fiber synapses (rather than through parallel fiber synapses), and a tonic activation of granule cell GABAA receptors (with an almost complete absence of synaptically induced inhibitory postsynaptic currents). The model predicts that, under conditions of strong mossy fiber input to the cerebellum, Golgi cells do not only control the strength of parallel fiber activity but also the timing of the individual spikes. Provided that their parallel fiber synapses constitute an important source of excitation, Golgi cells fire rhythmically and synchronized with granule cells over large distances along the parallel fiber axis.

At the resonant level of network excitation, all neurons fire synchronously and rhythmically with a period approximately four times the mean delay of the onset of the inhibitory synaptic current. ... By varying the axonal delay of the inhibitory connections, networks with a realistic synaptic kinetics can be tuned to frequencies from 40 to >200 Hz. ...

Specific antibodies were used to map the distribution of voltage-dependent sodium channels along the two unmyelinated axon-like processes of the bipolar ganglion cells. Three distinct hot spots were detected. A high density of sodium channels was present over the entire trajectory of sensory endings beneath the outer hair cells (the most distal portion of the peripheral axon). The other two hot spots were localized in the initial segments of both of the axons that flank the unmyelinated bipolar ganglion cell bodies.  A biophysical model indicates that all three hot spots might play important roles in action potential initiation and propagation. For instance, the hot spot in the receptor segment is important for transforming the receptor potentials into a full blown action potential (Supplemental Fig. 1). The hot spots in the two paraganglionic axon initial segments are there to ensure the successful propagation of action potentials from the peripheral to the central axon through the cell body.

In contrast to the uniformly distributed single-channel conductance, Ih channel number increases exponentially with distance, reaching densities as high as approximately 550 channels/microm2 at distal dendritic sites. These high channel densities generate significant membrane voltage noise. By incorporating a stochastic model of Ih single-channel gating into a morphologically realistic model of a layer 5 neuron, we show that this channel noise is higher in distal dendritic compartments and increased threefold with a 10-fold increased single-channel conductance (6.8 pS) but constant Ih current density. ...

Coordinate transformations between different reference frames are therefore required. One way to achieve this relies on the encoding of spatial information using population codes. The set of network responses to stimuli in different locations (tuning curves) constitute a basis set of functions which can be combined linearly through weighted synaptic connections in order to approximate non-linear transformations of the input variables. The question then arises how the appropriate synaptic connectivity is obtained.   This model shows that a network of spiking neurons can learn the coordinate transformation from one frame of reference to another, with connectivity that develops continuously in an unsupervised manner, based only on the correlations available in the environment, and with a biologically-realistic plasticity mechanism (spike timing-dependent plasticity).",

Our paper investigates the link between this mutation and the \"barrelless\" phenotype, and demonstrates that the loss-of-function mutation leads to deficits in presynaptic mechanisms at the thalamocortical synapse.  How might presynaptic deficits disrupt whisker-specific segregation in the barrel cortex? We used a model to demonstrate one possibility: decrease in the release probability at the thalamocortical synapse (which is observed in the barrelless mutant) can influence the balance between LTP and LTD (in favor of LTD), which can disrupt whisker segregaton. Though how this occurs is easily explained with a conceptual model (described succinctly in the associated paper), we also produced a computational simulation of this phenomenon.",

During spontaneous bursting of dopaminergic neurons in vivo, bursts related to reward expectation in behaving animals, and bursts generated by dendritic application of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) agonists, transient firing attains rates well above this range. We suggest a way such highfrequency firing may occur in response to dendritic NMDA receptor activation. We have extended the coupled oscillator model of the dopaminergic neuron, which represents the soma and dendrites as electrically coupled compartments with different natural spiking frequencies, by addition of dendritic AMPA (voltage-independent) or NMDA (voltage-dependent) synaptic conductance. Both soma and dendrites contain a simplified version of the calcium-potassium mechanism known to be the mechanism for slow spontaneous oscillation and background firing in dopaminergic cells.  We show that because of its voltage dependence, NMDA receptor activation acts to amplify the effect on the soma of the high-frequency oscillation of the dendrites, which is normally too weak to exert a large influence on the overall oscillation frequency of the neuron.",

This CPG is a multifunctional circuit and generates at least two types of buccal motor patterns (BMPs), one that mediates ingestion (iBMP) and another that mediates rejection (rBMP). The present study used a computational approach to examine the ways in which an ensemble of identified cells and synaptic connections function as a CPG. Hodgkin-Huxley-type models were developed that mimicked the biophysical properties of these cells and synaptic connections. The results suggest that the currently identified ensemble of cells is inadequate to produce rhythmic neural activity and that several key elements of the CPG remain to be identified.",

In this neuron model, reduced [Ca2+]o is simulated by negatively shifting the activation curve of the persistent Na+ current (INaP), as indicated by recent experimental results. The neuron model accounts, with different parameter sets, for the diversity of firing patterns observed experimentally in both zero and normal [Ca2+]o. Increasing INaP in the neuron model induces bursting and increases the number of spikes within a burst, but is neither necessary nor sufficient for bursting. We show, using fast-slow analysis and bifurcation theory, that the M-type K+ current (IM) allows bursting by shifting neuronal behavior between a silent and a tonically-active state, provided the kinetics of the spike generating currents are sufficiently, though not extremely, fast. We suggest that bursting in CA1 pyramidal cells can be explained by a single compartment *square bursting* mechanism with one slow variable, the activation of IM.  See paper for more and details.",

This is achieved by a proper interplay of synchronizing and desynchronizing interactions in a multilayer network, where each layer is responsible for tracking a single target. The results of the model simulation are presented and compared with experimental data.

        "text": "Patients with Andersen-Tawil syndrome (ATS) mostly have mutations on the KCNJ2 gene producing loss of function or  dominant-negative suppression of the inward rectifier K(+) channel Kir2.1. However, clinical manifestations of ATS  including dysmorphic features, periodic paralysis (hypo-, hyper-, or normokalemic), long QT, and ventricular arrhythmias  (VA) are considerably variable. Using a modified dynamic Luo-Rudy simulation model of cardiac ventricular myocyte, we  elucidate the mechanisms of VA in ATS. We adopted a kinetic model of KCNJ2 in which channel block by Mg(+2) and  spermine was incorporated. In this study, we attempt to examine the effects of KCNJ2 mutations on the ventricular action  potential (AP), single-channel Markovian models were reformulated and incorporated into the dynamic Luo-Rudy model  for rapidly and slowly delayed rectifying K(+) currents and KCNJ2 channel. During pacing at 1.0 Hz with [K(+)]o at 5.4  mM, a stepwise 10% reduction of Kir2.1 channel conductance progressively prolonged the terminal repolarization phase  of AP along with gradual depolarization of the resting membrane potential (RMP). At 90% reduction, early after- depolarizations (EADs) became inducible and RMP was depolarized to -55.0 mV (control: -90.1 mV) followed by  emergence of spontaneous action potentials (SAP). Both EADs and SAP were facilitated by a decrease in [K(+)]o and  suppressed by increase in [K(+)]o. beta-adrenergic stimulation enhanced delayed after-depolarizations (DADs) and could  also facilitate EADs as well as SAP in the setting of low [K(+)]o and reduced Kir2.1 channel conductance. In conclusion,  the spectrum of VA in ATS includes (1) triggered activity mediated by EADs and/or DADs, and (2) abnormal automaticity  manifested as SAP. These VA can be aggravated by a decrease in [K(+)]o and beta-adrenergic stimulation, and may  potentially induce torsades de pointes and cause sudden death. In patients with ATS, the hypokalemic form of periodic  paralysis should have the highest propensity to VA especially during physical activities.",

        "text": "1. Membrane currents during step depolarizations were determined by  a method in which three electrodes were inserted near the end of a  fibre in the frog's sartorius muscle. The theoretical basis and  limitations of the method are discussed. 2. Measurements of the membrane capacity (CM) and resting resistance  (RM) derived from the current during a step change in membrane  potential are consistent with values found by other methods. 3. In fibres made mechanically inactive with hypertonic solutions  (Ringer solution plus 350 mM sucrose) step depolarizations produced  ionic currents which resembled those of nerve in showing (a) an early  transient inward current, abolished by tetrodotoxin, which reversed  when the depolarization was carried beyond an internal potential of  about +20 mV, (b) a delayed outward current, with a linear instantaneous  current\u00a1Xvoltage relation, and a mean equilibrium potential with a normal  potassium concentration (2\u00a1P5 mM) of -85 mV. 4. The reversal potential for the early current appears to be consistent with the sodium equilibrium potential expected in hypertonic solutions. 5. The variation of the equilibrium potential for the delayed current  (V\u00a1\u00acK) with external potassium concentration suggests that the channel  for delayed current has a ratio of potassium to sodium permeability of  30:1; this is less than the resting membrane where the ratio appears  to be 100:1. V\u00a1\u00acK corresponds well with the membrane potential at the  beginning of the negative after-potential observed under similar conditions. 6. The variation of V\u00a1\u00acK with the amount of current which has passed  through the delayed channel suggests that potassium ions accumulate in a  space of between 1/3 and 1/6 of the fibre volume. If potassium accumulates in  the transverse tubular system (T system) much greater variation in V\u00a1\u00acK  would be expected. 7. The delayed current is not maintained but is inactivated like the early  current. The inactivation is approximately exponential with a time constant  of 0\u00a1P5 to 1 sec at 20\u00a2X C. The steady-state inactivation of the potassium  current is similar to that for the sodium current, but its voltage  dependence is less steep and the potential for half inactivation is 20 mV  rate more positive. 8. Reconstructions of ionic currents were made in terms of the parameters (m, n, h) of the Hodgkin\u00a1XHuxley model for the squid axon, using constants  which showed a similar dependence on voltage. 9. Propagated action potentials and conduction velocities were computed for  various conditions on the assumption that the T system behaves as if it were  a series resistance and capacity in parallel with surface capacity and the  channels for sodium, potassium and leak current. There was reasonable  agreement with observed values, the main difference being that the  calculated velocities and rates of rise were somewhat less than those  observed experimentally.",

Using specific formulations of the K+, Na+, and Ca2+ currents based on  data recorded from human atrial myocytes, along with representations of pump, exchange, and  background currents, we developed a mathematical model of the AP. The model AP resembles APs  recorded from human atrial samples and responds to rate changes, L-type Ca2+ current blockade,  Na+/Ca2+ exchanger inhibition, and variations in transient outward current amplitude in a  fashion similar to experimental recordings. Rate-dependent adaptation of AP duration, an  important determinant of susceptibility to atrial fibrillation, was attributable to  incomplete L-type Ca2+ current recovery from inactivation and incomplete delayed rectifier  current deactivation at rapid rates. Experimental observations of variable AP morphology  could be accounted for by changes in transient outward current density, as suggested  experimentally. We conclude that this mathematical model of the human atrial AP reproduces  a variety of observed AP behaviors and provides insights into the mechanisms of clinically  important AP properties.",

We show that a transient potassium (KA) current allows the Fast Spiking (FS) interneuron to strike a balance between sensitivity to correlated input and robustness to noise, thereby increasing its signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). First, a compartmental FS neuron model was created to match experimental data from striatal FS interneurons in cortex\u2013striatum\u2013substantia nigra organotypic cultures. Densities of sodium, delayed rectifier, and KA channels were optimized to replicate responses to somatic current injection. Spontaneous AMPA and GABA synaptic currents were adjusted to the experimentally measured amplitude, rise time, and interevent interval histograms. Second, two additional adjustments were required to emulate the remaining experimental observations. GABA channels were localized closer to the soma than AMPA channels to match the synaptic population reversal potential. Correlation among inputs was required to produce the observed firing rate during up-states. In this final model, KA channels were essential for suppressing down-state spikes while allowing reliable spike generation during up-states. ... Our results suggest that KA channels allow FS interneurons to operate without a decrease in SNR during conditions of increased dopamine, as occurs in response to reward or anticipated reward.

Thus the objective of the study was to identify the mechanisms underlying these differences. The approach was to develop a type B model that reproduced characteristics of type B photoreceptors recorded in vitro, and then to create a type A model by modifying a select number of ionic currents. Comparison of type A models with characteristics of type A photoreceptors recorded in vitro revealed that type A and type B photoreceptors have five main differences, three that have been characterized experimentally and two that constitute hypotheses to be tested with experiments in the future.

Here we report that bursting neurons posses a hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih) that is two-fold larger (conductance: 5.3 \u00c2\u00b1 0.5 nS) than in regularspiking neurons (2.2 \u00c2\u00b1 0.6 nS), while Ih exhibits similar voltage-dependent and kinetic properties in both classes of neurons. Bursting and regular-spiking neurons display similar morphology. The difference in Ih between the two classes is not responsible for the distinct firing patterns, since neither pharmacological blockade of Ih nor enhancement of Ih using a dynamic clamp affects the qualitative firing patterns. Instead, the difference in Ih between bursting and regular-spiking neurons determines the temporal integration of evoked synaptic input from the CA1 area. In response to 50 Hz stimulation, bursting neurons, with a large Ih, show ~50% less temporal summation than regular-spiking neurons.  ...  A computer simulation model of a subicular neuron with the properties of either a bursting or a regular-spiking neuron confirmed the pivotal role of Ih in temporal integration of synaptic input. These data suggest that in the subicular network, bursting neurons are better suited to discriminate the content of high frequency input, such as that occurring during gamma oscillations, compared to regular-spiking neurons.

With computer modelling, we show that in channels with relatively slow opening kinetics and fast mode-shift transitions, such as HCN2 and HCN4 channels, the mode shift effects are not readily observable, except in the tail kinetics. Computer simulations of sino-atrial node action potentials suggest that the HCN2 channel, together with the HCN1 channel, are important regulators of the heart firing frequency and that the mode shift is an important property to prevent arrhythmic firing.

Furthermore the strength of an afferent stimulation needed to disrupt delay-type activity increased with the magnitude of the dopamine-induced shifts in network parameters, making the currently active representation much more stable. Stability could be increased by dopamine-induced enhancements of the persistent Na(+) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) conductances. Stability also was enhanced by a reduction in AMPA conductances. The increase in GABA(A) conductances that occurs after stimulation of dopaminergic D1 receptors was necessary in this context to prevent uncontrolled, spontaneous switches into high-activity states (i.e., spontaneous activation of task-irrelevant representations). In conclusion, the dopamine-induced changes in the biophysical properties of intrinsic ionic and synaptic conductances conjointly acted to highly increase stability of activated representations in PFC networks and at the same time retain control over network behavior and thus preserve its ability to adequately respond to task-related stimuli. ...\" See paper and references for more and details.",

We examined the relationship between dendritic arborization and the coupling between somatic and dendritic action potential (AP) initiation sites in layer 5 (L5) neocortical pyramidal neurons. Coupling was defined as the relative reduction in threshold for initiation of a dendritic calcium AP due to a coincident back-propagating AP. Simulations based on reconstructions of biocytin-filled cells showed that addition of oblique branches of the main apical dendrite in close proximity to the soma (d < 140 um) increases the coupling between the apical and axosomatic AP initiation zones, whereas incorporation of distal branches decreases coupling. ... We conclude that variation in dendritic arborization may be a key determinant of variability in coupling (49+-17%; range 19-83%; n = 37) and is likely to outweigh the contribution made by variations in active membrane properties. Thus coincidence detection of inputs arriving from different cortical layers is strongly regulated by differences in dendritic arborization.\"",

Second, we show that the trough is present for ACTs calculated from the discharge of a threshold-crossing neurone model with a postspike after- hyperpolarization (AHP), but absent from those calculated from the discharge of a model without an AHP. We show that it is possible to represent noise-driven discharge using a two-component linear model that predicts discharge probability based on the sum of a feedback kernel and a stimulus kernel. The feedback kernel re&#64258;ects the in&#64258;uence of prior discharge mediated by the AHP, and it increases in amplitude when AHP amplitude is increased by pharmacological manipulations.

Surprisingly, both types of afferents also encoded their nonpreferred stimulus attribute when it was presented in isolation or when the preferred stimulus attribute was sufficiently weak. Because afferent activity can be affected by modulations in either amplitude or phase, it is not possible to unambiguously distinguish between these two stimulus attributes by observing the activity of a single afferent fiber. Simple model neurons with a preference for encoding either amplitude or phase also encoded their nonpreferred stimulus attribute when it was presented in isolation, suggesting that such ambiguity is unavoidable. ... \" See paper for more and details.",

The weakly electric fish Gymnarchus discriminates the sign of the frequency difference (Df) between a neighbor\u2019s electric organ discharge (EOD) and its own EOD by comparing temporal patterns of amplitude modulation (AM) and phase modulation (PM). Sign-selective neurons in the midbrain respond preferentially to either positive frequency differences (Df >0 selective) or negative frequency differences (Df <0 selective). To study the mechanisms of combination sensitivity, we made whole cell intracellular recordings from sign-selective midbrain neurons in vivo and recorded postsynaptic potential (PSP) responses to AM, PM, Df >0, and Df <0. ... Responses to the nonpreferred sign of Df, but not the preferred sign of Df, were substantially weaker than linear predictions, causing a significant increase in the actual degree of sign selectivity. By using various levels of current clamp and comparing our results to simple models of synaptic integration, we demonstrate that this decreased response to the nonpreferred sign of Df is caused by a reduction in voltage-dependent excitatory conductances. This finding reveals that nonlinear decoders, in the form of voltage-dependent conductances, can enhance the selectivity of single neurons for particular combinations of stimulus attributes.\"  See paper for more and details.",

First, several elegant features are exposed--capacity scaling, enhanced selectivity and synergistic dopamine modulation--which might be expected to exist in a well designed action selection mechanism. Second, good matches between model GPe output and GPi and SNr output, and neurophysiological data, have been found. Third, the behaviour of the model as a signal selection mechanism has parallels with some kinds of action selection observed in animals under various levels of dopaminergic modulation.

First, low salience actions (i.e. those with low urgency) could be selected. Second, the range of salience values over which actions could be switched between was increased. Third, the contrast between the selected and non-selected actions was enhanced via improved differentiation of outputs from the BG. Fourth, transient increases in the salience of a non-selected action were prevented from interrupting the ongoing action, unless the transient was of sufficient magnitude. Finally, the selection of the ongoing action persisted when a new closely matched salience action became active. The first result was facilitated by the thalamocortical loop; the rest were dependent on the presence of the TRN.

How does the brain know what firing patterns of what neurons are responsible for the reward if 1) the patterns are no longer there when the reward arrives and 2) all neurons and synapses are active during the waiting period to the reward? Here, we show how the conundrum is resolved by a model network of cortical spiking neurons with spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) modulated by dopamine (DA). Although STDP is triggered by nearly coincident firing patterns on a millisecond timescale, slow kinetics of subsequent synaptic plasticity is sensitive to changes in the extracellular DA concentration during the critical period of a few seconds. ... This study emphasizes the importance of precise firing patterns in brain dynamics and suggests how a global diffusive reinforcement signal in the form of extracellular DA can selectively influence the right synapses at the right time.\" See paper for more and details.",

However, little is known regarding the mechanism of ZNS actions on ion currents in neurons.  We thus investigated its effect on ion currents in differentiated hippocampal 19-7 cells.  The ZNS (30 uM) reversibly increased the amplitude of K+ outward currents and paxilline (1 uM) was effective in suppressing ZNS-induced increase of K+ outward currents.  In inside-out configuration, ZNS (30 uM) applied to the intracellular face of the membrane did not alter single-channel conductance; however, it did enhance the activity of large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BKCa) channels primarily by decreasing mean closed time.  The EC50 value for ZNS-stimulated BKCa channels was 34 uM.  This drug caused a left shift in the activation curve of BKCa channels with no change in the gating charge of these channels.  ZNS at a concentration greater than 100 uM also reduced the amplitude of A-type K+ current in these cells.  A simulation modeling based on hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons (Pinsky-Rinzel model) was also analyzed to investigate the inhibitory effect of ZNS on the firing of simulated action potentials.  Taken together, this study suggests that in hippocampal neurons, during the exposure to ZNS, the ZNS-mediated effects on BKCa channels and IA could be one of the ionic mechanisms through which it affects neuronal excitability.",

The method was validated by testing simulated twitch data from a mathematical model of the neuromuscular system. Computer simulations followed the same stimulus-response protocol and produced waveform data that were indistinguishable from experiments. ... The ITS-MUNE analysis method has the potential to quantitatively measure the progression of motor neuron diseases and therefore the efficacy of treatments designed to alleviate pathologic processes of muscle denervation.\"  The software is available for download under the \"ITS-MUNE software\" link at  (see below for links).\"",

When the mutation was placed in the rat Nav1.1 channel and expressed in Xenopus oocytes, the mutant channel displayed a positive shift in the voltage-dependence of sodium channel activation, slower recovery from slow inactivation, and lower levels of current compared to the wild-type channel. Computational analysis suggests that neurons expressing the mutant channel have higher thresholds for firing a single action potential and for firing multiple action potentials, along with decreased repetitive firing. Therefore, this mutation should lead to decreased neuronal excitability, in contrast to most previous GEFS+ sodium channel mutations that have changes predicted to increase neuronal firing.",

In this article we derive an analytical approximation for the single-pulse model, which is then extended to describe the pulse-train model in the case of evenly timed, uniform pulses.

Surges of PRL secretion occur in response to relief from hypothalamic dopaminergic inhibition and stimulation by hypothalamic releasing neurohormones. In this study, we characterized the role of oxytocin (OT) in this system and the involvement of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) from the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in controlling OT and PRL secretion of CS rats. ... OT measurements of serial blood samples obtained from ovariectomized (OVX) CS rats displayed a prominent increase at the time of the afternoon PRL peak. The injection of VIP antisense oligonucleotides into the SCN abolished the afternoon increase of OT and PRL in CS-OVX animals. These findings suggest that VIP from the SCN contributes to the regulation of OT and PRL secretion in CS rats. We propose that in CS rats the regulatory mechanism(s) for PRL secretion comprise coordinated action of neuroendocrine dopaminergic and OT cells, both governed by the daily rhythm of VIP-ergic output from the SCN. This hypothesis is illustrated with a mathematical model.\"",

IBK always increased the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, while IA could either increase or decrease it. Thus, the stimulatory effects of DA could be mediated by a fast K+ conductance which converts tonically spiking cells to bursters.

However, one major facet of uncertainty has received comparatively little attention: time. In a dynamic, rapidly changing world, data are only temporarily relevant.

Within this model, DBS performance is assessed in two ways. First, we determine the extent to which DBS causes Gpi (globus pallidus pars interna) synaptic outputs, which are burstlike and synchronized in the unstimulated Parkinsonian state, to cease their pathological modulation of simulated thalamocortical cells. Second, we evaluate how DBS affects the GPi cells' auto- and cross-correlograms.",

However, walking from cell to cell over large distances with a glass pipette is challenging, and microinjection of (fluorescent) dyes diffusing through gap-junctions remains so far the only method available to decipher such microcircuits even though technical limitations exist.  Based on circuit theory, we derived analytical descriptions of the AC electrical coupling in networks of isopotential cells. We then proposed an operative electrophysiological protocol to distinguish between direct electrical connections and connections involving one or more intermediate cells.   This method allows inferring the number of intermediate cells, generalizing the conventional coupling coefficient, which provides limited information.   We provide here some analysis and simulation scripts that used to test our method through computer simulations, in vitro recordings, theoretical and numerical methods.

In this study, the authors relate electrophysiologic patterns typically observed during the transition from interictal to ictal activity in human mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) to mechanisms (at a neuronal population level) involved in seizure generation through a computational model of EEG activity. Intracerebral EEG signals recorded from hippocampus in five patients with MTLE during four periods (during interictal activity, just before seizure onset, during seizure onset, and during ictal activity) were used to identify the three main parameters of a model of hippocampus EEG activity (related to excitation, slow dendritic inhibition and fast somatic inhibition). ... . Results demonstrated that the model generates very realistic signals for automatically identified parameters. They also showed that the transition from interictal to ictal activity cannot be simply explained by an increase in excitation and a decrease in inhibition but rather by time-varying ensemble interactions between pyramidal cells and local interneurons projecting to either their dendritic or perisomatic region (with slow and fast GABAA kinetics). Particularly, during preonset activity, an increasing dendritic GABAergic inhibition compensates a gradually increasing excitation up to a brutal drop at seizure onset when faster oscillations (beta and low gamma band, 15 to 40 Hz) are observed. ... These findings obtained from model identification in human temporal lobe epilepsy are in agreement with some results obtained experimentally, either on animal models of epilepsy or on the human epileptic tissue.\"",

The present study concerns a neurobiologically based computational model of the emergence of theta phase precession in which the responses of a single model CA3 pyramidal cell are examined in the context of stimulation by realistic afferent spike trains including those of place cells in entorhinal cortex, dentate gyrus, and other CA3 pyramidal cells.  Spike-timing dependent plasticity in the model CA3 pyramidal cell leads to a spatially correlated associational synaptic drive that subsequently creates a spatially asymmetric expansion of the model cell\u2019s place field. ... Through selective manipulations of the model it is possible to decompose theta phase precession in CA3 into the separate contributing factors of inheritance from upstream afferents in the dentate gyrus and entorhinal cortex, the interaction of synaptically controlled increasing afferent drive with phasic inhibition, and the theta phase difference between dentate gyrus granule cell and CA3 pyramidal cell activity.\"",

Using a combination of electrophysiological, molecular, and computational approaches, the studies reported here show that D2 dopamine receptor modulation of Na+ currents underlying autonomous spiking contributes to a slowing of discharge rate, such as that seen in vivo. Four lines of evidence support this conclusion. ... Fourth, simulation of cholinergic interneuron pacemaking revealed that a modest increase in the entry of Na+ channels into the slow-inactivated state was sufficient to account for the slowing of pacemaker discharge. These studies establish a cellular mechanism linking dopamine and the reduction in striatal cholinergic interneuron activity seen in the initial stages of associative learning.\" See paper for more and details.",
