    "Naive Bayes is popular for test classification and this exercise demonstrates why. Because there are so many words(features) in the text volume overall, Naive Bayes allows you to assess all relevant features in a document at one time and combine their prior probabilities to predict the class of the new document. Decision tree is less flexible. The algorithm is developed to pick the most polarized features first and then assign class based on value of one feature at a time. Once classified, the algorithm can't then reassess the other features in the document to refine the likelihood of the correct class. So it makes sense that the decision tree classifiers perform less well than the naive bayes classifiers.  But naive bayes seems to lose it's power as the classification becomes more subtle (as when the text documents are on very similar topics) and error rate approaches that of decision tree. Which by the way is pretty close to chance. "
